KRISHI BOT  

With the increasing demands for organic fruits and vegetables in the future, it is
imperative to find novel solutions to sustain agriculture using technology. In this theme, participants will
program an agriculture automation robot for future cities that can navigate a greenhouse and perform
harvesting. Through this theme, participants will develop an algorithm for:

 *Autonomous navigation of mobile robot in greenhouse 
 *Detection and localizing of the vegetables 
 *Manipulation of a robotic arm to harvest vegetables

 Tech Required :Robot Operating System (ROS), Gazebo, MoveIt, OpenCV, Git.
