# KRISHI BOT

With the increasing demands for organic fruits and vegetables in the
future, it is imperative to find novel solutions to sustain agriculture
using technology. In this theme, participants will program an
agriculture automation robot for future cities that can navigate a
greenhouse and perform harvesting. Through this theme, participants will
develop an algorithm for:

   - **Autonomous navigation of mobile robot in greenhouse**: The robot should be able to move around the greenhouse without human intervention, avoiding obstacles and navigating efficiently.

   - **Detection and localizing of the vegetables**: Utilizing computer vision techniques, the robot will need to identify and precisely locate the vegetables within the greenhouse for harvesting.

   - **Manipulation of a robotic arm to harvest vegetables**: Once the vegetables are detected and localized, the robot should be able to use its robotic arm to carefully harvest them without causing damage.

## Developed Using:

   - **Robot Operating System (ROS)**: ROS is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It will serve as the backbone for your robot's control and communication.

   - **Gazebo**: Gazebo is a simulation tool that will allow you to simulate the robot's actions and interactions within a virtual greenhouse environment, helping you test and develop your algorithms before deployment.

   - **MoveIt**: MoveIt is a motion planning framework that will enable your robot to plan and execute precise movements, especially when manipulating the robotic arm for harvesting.

   - **OpenCV**: OpenCV is a powerful computer vision library that will assist in detecting and localizing vegetables within the greenhouse.

   - **Git**: Git is a version control system that will help you manage and collaborate on your project's codebase effectively. It's essential for tracking changes and working with a team of developers.
